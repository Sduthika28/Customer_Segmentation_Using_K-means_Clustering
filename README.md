## 📘 About the Project

Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used by companies to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. In this project, we analyze a mall customer dataset containing features such as **age, gender, annual income, and spending score**. By applying K-Means clustering, we uncover hidden patterns that allow businesses to:

- Identify high-value customers  
- Personalize marketing campaigns  
- Improve customer retention  
- Optimize business strategies  

This project includes **EDA, data preprocessing, cluster modeling, PCA visualization, and actionable marketing insights**.
